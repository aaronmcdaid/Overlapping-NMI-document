	abstract = "Recent researches have discovered that rich interactions among entities in nature and society bring about complex networks with community structures. Although the investigation of the community structures has promoted the development of many successful algorithms, most of them only find separated communities, while for the vast majority of real-world networks, communities actually overlap to some extent. Moreover, the vertices of networks can often belong to different domains as well. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm BiTector Bi-community De-tector) to efficiently mine overlapping communities in large-scale sparse bipartite networks. It only depends on the network topology, and does not require any priori knowledge about the number or the original partition of the network. We apply the algorithm to real-world data from different domains, showing that BiTector can successfully identifies the overlapping community structures of the bipartite networks.",

Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.",

	abstract = "A universal estimation formula for the average path length of scale free networks is given in this paper. Different from other estimation formulas, most of which use the size of network, N, as the only parameter, two parameters including N and a second parameter a are included in our formula. The parameter a is the power-law exponent, which represents the local connectivity property of a network. Because of this, the formula captures an important property that the local connectivity property at a microscopic level can determine the global connectivity of the whole network. The use of this new parameter distinguishes this approach from the other estimation formulas, and makes it a universal estimation formula, which can be applied to all types of scale-free networks. The conclusion is made that the small world feature is a derivative feature of a scale free network. If a network follows the power-law degree distribution, it must be a small world network. The power-law degree distribution property, while making the network economical, preserves the efficiency through this small world property when the network is scaled up. In other words, a real scale-free network is scaled at a relatively small cost and a relatively high efficiency, and that is the desirable result of self-organization optimization.",

Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e., the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization, and Potts model clustering. The results show that the benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.",

With scant information about a target individual, people can successively forward a message along such a chain. Experimental studies have verified this property in real social networks, and theoretical models have been advanced to explain it. However, existing theoretical models have not been shown to capture behavior in real-world social networks. Here, we introduce a richer model relating geography and social-network friendship, in which the probability of befriending a particular person is inversely proportional to the number of closer people. In a large social network, we show that one-third of the friendships are independent of geography and the remainder exhibit the proposed relationship. Further, we prove analytically that short chains can be discovered in every network exhibiting the relationship.",

	abstract = "Social networks evolve over time, driven by the shared activities and affiliations of their members, by similarity of individuals' attributes, and by the closure of short network cycles. We analyzed a dynamic social network comprising 43,553 students, faculty, and staff at a large university, in which interactions between individuals are inferred from time-stamped e-mail headers recorded over one academic year and are matched with affiliations and attributes. We found that network evolution is dominated by a combination of effects arising from network topology itself and the organizational structure in which the network is embedded. In the absence of global perturbations, average network properties appear to approach an equilibrium state, whereas individual properties are unstable.",

	abstract = "Predicting linkages among data objects is a fundamental data mining task in various application domains, including recommender systems, information retrieval, automatic Web hyperlink generation, record linkage, and communication surveilance. In many contexts link prediction is entirely based on the linkage information itself (a prominent example is the collaborative filtering recommendation). Link-structure based link prediction is closely related to a parallel and almost separate stream of research on topological modeling of large-scale graphs. Graph topological modeling builds on random graph theory to find parsimonious graph generation models reproducing empirical topological measures that summarize the global structure of a graph, such as clustering coefficient, average path length, and degree distribution. These well-studied topological measures and graph generation models have direct implications on link prediction. This paper represents initial efforts to explore the connection between link prediction and graph topology. The focus is exclusively on the predictive value of the clustering coefficient measure. The standard clustering coefficient measure is generalized to capture higher-order clustering tendencies. The proposed framework consists of a cycle formation link probability model, a procedure for estimating model parameters based on the generalized clustering coefficients, and model-based link prediction generation. Using the Enron email dataset we demonstrate that the proposed cycle formation model corresponded closely with the actual link probabilities and the link prediction algorithm based on this model outperformed existing algorithms.",

We apply the relational Markov network framework of Taskar et al. to define a joint probabilistic model over the entire link graph--- entity attributes and links. The application of the RMN algorithm to this task requires the definition of probabilistic patterns over subgraph structures. We apply this method to two new relational datasets, one involving university webpages, and the other a social network. We show that the collective classification approach of RMNs, and the introduction of subgraph patterns over link labels, provide significant improvements in accuracy over flat classification, which attempts to predict each link in isolation.",

    abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental for uncovering the links between structure and function in complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.},

@article{ SCP,
    abstract = {In complex network research clique percolation, introduced by Palla et al.,
is a deterministic community detection method, which allows for overlapping
communities and is purely based on local topological properties of a network.
Here we present a sequential clique percolation algorithm (SCP) to do fast
community detection in weighted and unweighted networks, for cliques of a
chosen size. This method is based on sequentially inserting the constituent
links to the network and simultaneously keeping track of the emerging community
structure. Unlike existing algorithms, the SCP method allows for detecting
k-clique communities at multiple weight thresholds in a single run, and can
simultaneously produce a dendrogram representation of hierarchical community
structure. In sparse weighted networks, the SCP algorithm can also be used for
implementing the weighted clique percolation method recently introduced by
Farkas et al. The computational time of the SCP algorithm scales linearly with
the number of k-cliques in the network. As an example, the method is applied to

@article{ CombinedAPMS,
    abstract = {Defining protein complexes is critical to virtually all aspects of cell biology. Two recent affinity purification/mass spectrometry studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have vastly increased the available protein interaction data. The practical utility of such high throughput interaction sets, however, is substantially decreased by the presence of false positives. Here we created a novel probabilistic metric that takes advantage of the high density of these data, including both the presence and absence of individual associations, to provide a measure of the relative confidence of each potential protein-protein interaction. This analysis largely overcomes the noise inherent in high throughput immunoprecipitation experiments. For example, of the 12,122 binary interactions in the general repository of interaction data (BioGRID) derived from these two studies, we marked 7504 as being of substantially lower confidence. Additionally, applying our metric and a stringent cutoff we identified a set of 9074 interactions (including 4456 that were not among the 12,122 interactions) with accuracy comparable to that of conventional small scale methodologies. Finally we organized proteins into coherent multisubunit complexes using hierarchical clustering. This work thus provides a highly accurate physical interaction map of yeast in a format that is readily accessible to the biological community.},

@article{Latouche:OSBM,
    abstract = {Complex systems in nature and in society are often represented as networks,
describing the rich set of interactions between objects of interest. Many
deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to
analyze such structures. Given a network, almost all of them partition the
vertices into \emph{disjoint} clusters, according to their connection profile.
However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive
and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To
tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block
Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to
some extent, generalizes the well known Stochastic Block Model. We show that
the model is generically identifiable within classes of equivalence and we
propose an approximate inference procedure, based on global and local
variational techniques. Using toy data sets, the French Political Blogosphere
network, and the transcriptional network of \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}, we
compare our work with other approaches.},

@unpublished{MOSES,
    abstract = {As research into community ﬁnding in social networks progresses, there is a need for algorithms capable of detecting overlapping community structure. Many algorithms have been proposed in recent years that are capable of assigning each node to more than a single community. The performance of these algorithms tends to degrade when the ground-truth contains a more highly overlapping community structure, with nodes assigned to more than two communities. Such highly overlapping structure is likely to exist in many social networks, such as Facebook friendship networks. In this paper we present a scalable algorithm, MOSES, based on a statistical model of community structure, which is capable of detecting highly overlapping community structure, especially when there is variance in the number of communities each node is in. In evaluation on synthetic data MOSES is found to be superior to existing algorithms, especially at high levels of overlap. We demonstrate MOSES on real social network data by analyzing the networks of friendship links between students of ﬁve US universities.},

@article{VinhEppsBailey,
    abstract = {{Information theoretic measures form a fundamental class of measures for comparing clusterings, and have recently received increasing interest. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0,1] range better than other normalized variants.}},
